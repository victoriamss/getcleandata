# getcleandata

This repo was created for a project assignment at the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, on Coursera.

It contains a script, "run_analysis.R", in which I expose the code I used for transforming a given dataset, in accordance with the instructions given at the course.

The repo also contains a code book, "CodeBook.md", in which I explain the variables used in the new dataset created for the project, as well as the transformations which were necessary to create it.

Thanks for assessing my work, and good luck on your Data Science courses!
